* manager method to get child status hash

  - for each selected daemons
    - is daemon running
    - is daemon enabled



* send data to child processes

  - still under consideration

  - option to create a named pipe for each child process
    - daemon_name.cmd

  - create named pipe 
    - open as STDIN in child process
    - child process can use this or simply ignore

  - manager method to send text to each daemon's named pipe
    - YAML/json filter?



* receive data from child processes

  - still under consideration

  - option for manager to open a named pipe
    - manager.cmd

  - non-blocking reads

  - child processes can write YAML/json data to manager
    - not written to filesystem

  - lock file?
    - only one managing process can read data from the pipe at a time

  - not reliable since there's no 'ack' for messages transmitted
    - could be lost
    - might get delivered to wrong manager process
