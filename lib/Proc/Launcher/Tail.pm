Proc::Launcher::Tail - poe-based 'tail -f' on selected process logs


=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is designed to be used from panctl.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over 8

=item $obj->tail( $manager )

This class contains only this one method.  It requires a reference to
a Proc::Launcher::Manager object in order to determine information
about that manager's daemons.

The log files of all selected files will be monitored for output, and
output will be displayed to the screen.  This is similar to 'tail -f'.
