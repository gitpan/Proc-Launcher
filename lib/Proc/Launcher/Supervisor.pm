Proc::Launcher::Supervisor - restart watched processes that have exited


=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a tiny module that's designed for use with panctl and
Proc::Launcher, where it is forked off and run as a separate process.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over 8

=item $obj->monitor( $manager )

This tiny class contains only this one method.  It requires a
reference to a Proc::Launcher::Manager object in order to determine
information about that manager's daemons.

It will repeatedly sleep for a configured period of time (default 15
seconds), and then call start_all() on the manager object.  This will
result in restarting any processes that have stopped.
